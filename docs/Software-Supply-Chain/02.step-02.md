# Step 2: Continuous Delivery

In this step, you will create a new continuous delivery workflow for the next version.

- _**Objective**_: Create a continuous delivery workflow using GitHub Actions for seamless and automated deployment.
- _**Outcome**_: Familiarize yourself with GitHub Packages and continuous delivery workflows.

## Instructions

### Create new workflow

1. Navigate to `.github/workflows` and create a new file with the name `02.packages.yml`.
2. Copy and paste the provided YAML code for running quality checks, UI tests, and security checks.

   ```yaml
      name: Package Container Image

      on:
        pull_request:
          branches:
            - main

      permissions:
        contents: read
        packages: write


      jobs:
        build-and-push:
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v3

            # Connect to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr)
            - name: Login to GitHub Container Registry
              uses: docker/login-action@v3
              with:
                registry: ghcr.io
                username: ${{ github.actor }}
                password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

            - name: Build and push to GHCR
              uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
              with:
                push: true
                context: ${{ github.workspace }}
                tags: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.sha }}
      ```

3. Commit and push the changes to the `continuous-integration-deployment` branch.
    - You can use the following command to commit and push the changes to the `feature` branch.

      ```bash
      git add .
      git commit -m "Add packages workflow"
      git push origin main
      ```

4. Navigate to the Actions tab on GitHub to view the workflow run.
5. Navigate to the Packages tab to view the container image.
